# LA-Bike-Share-Predictive-Model-DSC630-
Final project for DSC630 - Predictive Analytics class in BU. 
By exploring the bike ride share data, we will try to find answers for the below questions through some thorough exploratory data analysis and predictive modelling.

_Exploratory data analysis:_
* Initial Data Profiling
* Plotting correlation matrix
* Total rides by membership type
* Average trip duration by membership type
* Top 5 stations with the most starts (showing # of starts)
* Plot of active stations
* Most Popular Trip
* Bike traffic throughout the year

_Modeling statements:_
* Create a predictive model for predicting the usage rate for a given station, on a given day and hour. This helps to figure out the number of bikes that should be in stock to handle the demand of the riders.
* Classifying the stations based on the number of bikes they rent â€“ using unsupervised clustering algorithms.
* Predicting passholder that generates more revenue. For this predictive modelling, the cost for each pass holder type is taken from their website. This modelling is based on the assumption that bike rental costs are more or less same through out the period for which data was considered.
